# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog is intentionally initialized at the current maturity baseline.
Earlier exploratory evolution is treated as pre-history.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Specification evaluation with graded extension candidates (`proposals/2026-07-spec-evaluation.md`), scored with foresight's recommended set and expressed as `f/candidate` forms.
- User abstraction layer in `core`, closing the vocabulary–spec gap: `spell` (named reusable invocation pattern), `charm` (anonymous invocation for pipeline steps), and `incantation` (macro with a deterministic, inspectable expansion phase via `:expand :preview`).
- New core construct `grimoire` for packaging spells, lore, and shapes into a named, versioned practitioner grimoire, registrable via `asset`.
- New `:forbids` slot in the intent topology of `conjure`: load-bearing prohibitions with the same binding force as `:requires`, opposite sign.

### Changed

- Updated catalog and references (`index.edn`, `quick-reference.md`, `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, `conjurer.md`) for the expanded symbol surface (137 → 141).
- README no longer hardcodes the symbol count (it had drifted from `index.edn`).

## 1.1.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- New `foresight` grimoire (`f/`) for forward-looking deliberation with `f/candidate`, `f/reassess`, and `f/hoist`.
- New core construct `materialise` for two-phase target execution: deterministic preflight followed by semantic generation.

### Changed

- Updated catalog and references (`index.edn`, `quick-reference.md`, `README.md`, `SKILL.md`) to include the expanded grimoire/symbol surface.
- Extended `r/decide` with optional `:from-candidates` traceability to connect decisions to foresight candidates.
- Expanded `x/recover-stack` to model external package-sourced standards and distinguish `:implicit` conventions alongside `:declared` and `:enforced` evidence.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Mature, internally coherent Conjurer specification baseline.
- Complete standard grimoire library including `exhume` as reverse-flow complement.
- Unified symbol catalog and reference set for current language surface.

### Notes

- This entry marks the point where the project reached its current detailed and durable form.
