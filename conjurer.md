# Conjurer

*A declarative language for LLM interaction.*

---

## The central tension

Every programming language makes a wager about where intelligence lives. Conventional languages bet it lives in the machine: give the computer perfectly unambiguous instructions, and it will execute them faithfully. The human's job is translation — taking intent and grinding it down into syntax the parser will accept. The machine stays fixed; the human descends to meet it.

This wager made sense when the machine was a finite automaton. It makes less sense now.

Large language models do not parse strings against a grammar. They approximate meaning conditioned on context — which means they can accept semantic *equivalence classes*, not merely syntactic identity. The same intent expressed a dozen different ways produces the same result. Ambiguity, which compilers reject as error, LLMs resolve through inference. Context, which compilers discard as irrelevant, LLMs accumulate as interpretive mass.

Conjurer is a language built for this different machine. Its wager is the opposite: intelligence lives in the collaboration between human intent and model capability. The human stays at the level of intent; the machine ascends to meet them.

## Why "Conjurer"

The name carries more than etymology. It carries the entire design philosophy.

**From Clojure's `conj`.** Clojure's `conj` function adds an element to a collection while respecting the collection's natural structure. Add to a vector and the element appears at the end; add to a list and it appears at the front. The function understands the inherent character of each data structure and works *with* it rather than imposing uniform behavior.

```clojure
(conj [1 2 3] 4)   ;; => [1 2 3 4]  — vector: appends
(conj '(1 2 3) 4)  ;; => (4 1 2 3)  — list: prepends
```

Conjurer does the same for LLMs. It works with the model's natural strengths — contextual inference, semantic understanding, pattern recognition across vast domains — rather than forcing it into the rigid role of a syntax-checker. The phonetic similarity between *Clojure* and *Conjurer* is intentional: a lineage, not a coincidence.

**From the act of conjuring.** To conjure is to summon something into existence through seemingly magical means, yet with deliberate intent and understanding of underlying principles. This is precisely what happens when a Conjurer invocation is processed: the practitioner states what should exist, and the system brings it into being through trained understanding of patterns, structures, and relationships. The practitioner who conjures is not commanding — they are *invoking*. The word suggests collaboration, not dictation.

**From the grimoire tradition.** In historical magical practice, a grimoire is a textbook of spells — not a collection of arbitrary incantations but an organized body of knowledge, each spell encoding expertise about how to summon a particular kind of effect. Conjurer's libraries are grimoires in precisely this sense: thematic collections of invocations, each encoding deep domain expertise, each a literate artifact that teaches as much as it specifies.

---

## The paradigm shift

Understanding Conjurer requires understanding what it changes about the programmer's relationship to specification.

In conventional programming, a specification is a *contract with a parser*. Every character must be in the right place; every type must be declared; every edge case must be handled explicitly. The specification is complete or it is wrong.

In Conjurer, a specification is a *contract with understanding*. It must convey intent with sufficient clarity for the system to make good decisions — but it need not be exhaustive. The system fills gaps through contextual inference, domain knowledge, and established conventions. Gaps are not errors; they are invitations.

This changes what "correct" means. A Conjurer invocation is correct if it produces a manifestation that faithfully serves the practitioner's intent — regardless of whether every parameter was specified, regardless of whether the same words were used consistently, regardless of syntactic form. Correctness is semantic, not syntactic.

It also changes what "complete" means. A Conjurer program is never complete in the sense that a compiled program is complete — it is always open to refinement, always capable of being deepened, always responsive to new context. Completeness is progressive, not final.

## Eight design principles

### I. Declarative supremacy

Specify *what* should exist, not *how* to create it.

The force of declarative specification lies not in what it forbids — imperative instructions — but in what it liberates: specification at the level of intent. The distance between what a practitioner wants and what a machine executes is a *semantic* gap, not a syntactic one. Traditional languages close this gap by forcing the human downward. Conjurer reverses the direction: the machine ascends toward the human.

This is not a concession to imprecision. It is a redefinition of what precision means. Consider:

```clojure
(conjure inventory-reconciliation
  :strategy :eventual-consistency
  :conflict-resolution :last-write-wins
  :audit-trail true)
```

This declaration is *sharper* than a hundred lines of imperative code, because code fixes implementation details that may betray intent the moment the environment shifts — a different database, a different consistency model, a different team's conventions. The declaration survives. The implementation is regenerated from it, always faithful to the stated intent.

---

### II. Semantic richness over syntactic rigidity

Meaning matters more than form.

Conventional languages enforce syntactic precision because their parsers are finite automata: they accept or reject strings. An LLM is a probability distribution over meaning conditioned on context — which means it accepts semantic equivalence classes, not merely syntactic identity. Conjurer exploits this.

The following three invocations are equivalent. All are valid. All produce the same manifestation:

```clojure
(conjure user-form :validates [:email-format :age-minimum :password-strength])
(conjure user-form :ensures [:valid-email :legal-age :secure-password])
(conjure user-form :requires {:email :valid-format :age {:at-least 18}})
```

The language is not sloppy — it is *semantically polymorphic*. The same meaning, many legal expressions. Practitioners write in whatever vocabulary comes naturally to them. The system understands the intent regardless of the words used to express it.

---

### III. Semantic gravity

Context accumulates mass. The heavier it grows, the more precisely it determines interpretation — and the terser your invocations can become.

A single `context` declaration slightly biases how the system interprets ambiguous terms. A rich, multi-dimensional context nearly *determines* interpretation — ambiguity collapses under its mass. This is not a limitation; it is the mechanism by which sessions become increasingly expressive as shared understanding deepens.

```clojure
(context financial-services
  :domain :financial-services
  :regulations [:psd2 :aml-kyc]
  :entities {:transaction [:amount :currency :timestamp :counterparty]
             :account     [:id :balance :currency :risk-rating]})

;; This terse invocation is now fully determined:
(conjure transaction-processor)

;; Semantic gravity fills in: PSD2 strong authentication, AML monitoring,
;; ISO-4217 currency handling, EUR as default, audit trail on every operation.
;; The context carries the mass; the invocation carries only the delta.
```

The implication for experienced practitioners: invocations grow *shorter* as sessions mature, not longer. Complexity dissolves into context. This is the opposite of most programming — where specificity demands verbosity. In Conjurer, specificity is front-loaded into the context layer, and subsequent invocations reap the benefit.

---

### IV. Productive ambiguity

Some ambiguity is not a deficiency in the specification. It is a deliberate invitation for creative manifestation.

When a practitioner writes `"make this feel warmer and more encouraging for new users"`, the vagueness is not an error. It is a signal: *I trust your judgment here.* Over-specifying what "warmer" means would constrain outcomes the practitioner cannot anticipate. Productive ambiguity creates space for the system to discover good solutions that no complete specification would have reached.

Conjurer distinguishes two kinds of ambiguity:

**Resolvable ambiguity** — the intent is clear but underspecified; the system infers from context and proceeds, noting its interpretation. Most ambiguity is of this kind.

**Productive ambiguity** — the vagueness is deliberate; the system exercises judgment, explains its choices, and invites refinement. This is not a failure state — it is how the best collaborative work happens.

```clojure
;; Resolvable: the system knows what "customer" means from context
(conjure customer-report)

;; Productive: deliberately open — the system exercises UX judgment
(refine onboarding-flow
  "Make this feel warmer and more encouraging for new users")
;; System explains its interpretation choices; practitioner refines from there.
```

The key discipline: never mistake productive ambiguity for laziness. The practitioner who writes vaguely because they haven't thought it through is not practicing Conjurer well. The practitioner who writes vaguely because they trust the system to find good solutions is practicing it fluently.

---

### V. Progressive refinement

Complexity accretes. Initial invocations are sketches, not blueprints.

`refine` is not merely an enhancement mechanism — it is a *discovery tool*. The act of manifesting an initial, incomplete specification and then refining it often reveals requirements that were invisible before the first manifestation existed. The system's response becomes a mirror in which the practitioner sees what they actually wanted.

```clojure
;; Sketch — broad intent, minimal specification
(conjure recommendation-engine :for user-content-matching)

;; The manifestation reveals an assumption: collaborative filtering only.
;; The practitioner realizes new users have no history to filter from.

(refine recommendation-engine
  "Works well, but new users with no history get nothing useful.
   Add content-based fallback for users with fewer than 10 interactions.")

;; Now the practitioner sees the cold-start problem clearly.
(refine recommendation-engine
  :cold-start-threshold 10
  :cold-start-strategy :content-based
  :transition :hybrid-blended
  :diversity-weight 0.15
  :because "User feedback shows over-focusing causes boredom over time")
```

Three invocations. The first was nearly content-free. The second was natural language. The third was precise and reasoned. This is what progressive refinement looks like in practice: the language meets the practitioner wherever their understanding currently is, and moves with them toward clarity.

---

### VI. Intent topology

Not all parts of a specification are equally central. Conjurer acknowledges this.

Some requirements are *load-bearing* — the system fails without them, or worse, operates in silent violation of a constraint that matters. Some are *peripheral* — valuable if achievable, acceptable to defer if not. Some are *aesthetic* — style preferences that should inform but never override correctness. Some are *temporal* — right for a future iteration, premature now.

This structural property of intent is its *topology*. Conjurer makes it explicit:

```clojure
(conjure payment-processor
  :requires  [:pci-compliance :idempotency :audit-trail]
  :forbids   [:plaintext-pan-at-rest :silent-retries]
  :prefers   [:real-time-fraud-detection :multi-currency-support]
  :style     {:error-messages :user-friendly :verbosity :minimal}
  :deferred  [:analytics-integration :a-b-testing-hooks])
```

When constraints conflict — and in real systems they always eventually conflict — the topology tells the system how to choose. `:requires` always wins. `:forbids` carries the same force with the opposite sign: a manifestation containing a forbidden element is as incorrect as one missing a required capability. `:prefers` yields to `:requires` but ranks above `:style`. `:deferred` items are recorded but not manifested. The practitioner never has to adjudicate these trade-offs explicitly; the topology does it for them.

---

### VII. Calibrated certainty

Not all values in an invocation are equally committed. Some are bound — the practitioner has decided, and no substitution is acceptable. Some are leanings — preferences honoured when constraints permit. Some are illustrative — example values the system may freely replace. Conjurer makes this gradient *explicit* at the granularity where the decision lives: beside the value itself.

This is a different concern from intent topology. Topology addresses capability prioritization — which whole features are load-bearing. Calibrated certainty addresses value commitment — how strongly a specific number, keyword, or string binds the manifestation.

```clojure
(conjure transaction-screening
  :thresholds {
    :daily-limit       (certain (eur 10000))    ;; binding — likely a compliance threshold
    :velocity-window   (prefer  (minutes 5))    ;; reasonable default, tunable
    :anomaly-score-cut (allow   0.75)})         ;; illustrative — system may recalibrate
```

The same principle extends across the invocation lifecycle. `given` declares preconditions — facts taken as true *entering* an invocation, including deterministic MCP tool results treated as ground truth. `ensure` declares postconditions — properties that must hold of the *manifested result*, with explicit attribution of which enforcement layer verifies each.

This is the language admitting what it can and cannot do. Conjurer cannot generate parsers for every materialisation target. It does not promise mechanical determinism where only semantic determinism is achievable. What it does promise is that the practitioner has *vocabulary to declare exactly how strongly committed they are*, at exactly which point, and which layer is expected to enforce what — MCP-level structural checks, LLM-level semantic enforcement, or target-level tooling such as generated tests, linters, and type checkers. Declared intent with precise certainty markers converges toward behavioural determinism even when underlying token sequences vary.

The honesty matters. A language that pretends to deliver guarantees it cannot enforce is worse than one that names its limits and gives practitioners the means to work confidently within them.

---

### VIII. Collaborative discovery

The practitioner-system relationship in Conjurer is not command-and-execute. It is co-authorship.

The system does not merely execute specifications — it participates in clarifying them, surfacing tensions within them, and proposing improvements the practitioner had not anticipated. A system processing `(conjure checkout-flow :handles [:cart :payment :confirmation])` might manifest the artifact *and* note: "The payment step has no error-recovery path for gateway timeouts — I've added exponential retry with graceful degradation, but you may want to review the fallback messaging tone." This is not overreach. It is what a skilled collaborator does.

Collaborative discovery is surfaced through three constructs: `explain`, which makes the system's interpretive choices transparent on demand; `meta-query`, which lets the practitioner ask questions about the manifestation's assumptions and trade-offs; and `witness`, which captures the system's reasoning non-invasively as the session unfolds.

Together, these turn a Conjurer session from monologue into dialogue. The practitioner does not issue commands and receive deliverables. They engage in a conversation about intent, with the system as a capable, opinionated interlocutor.

## Ground truths: what we've learned

The eight principles describe how Conjurer is *built*. This section is different. These are the things that working with intent — manifesting it forward into artefacts, and exhuming it backward out of code — has *taught us*. They are not design decisions; they are observations about the nature of intent, evidence, meaning, and uncertainty that proved true again and again, often the hard way, and that now sit beneath the whole language. Where the principles are architecture, these are epistemology. They cohere around a single recognition: **intent is real, but it is never directly observable.** You always work with its traces — a specification, a pattern, a name, a commit — and the discipline is to know how much weight each trace can bear.

### Artefact is evidence of intent, not intent itself

The code is a witness, not a confession. A function name suggests a purpose but does not state one; a passing test attests behaviour but not the reason for it; a module boundary reveals a decision but not why it was made or what was rejected. What an artefact *does* can be read directly; what its author *meant* must be inferred, and the inference is always partial. Conjurer never collapses the two — which is why `exhume` grades every recovered claim as attested or inferred, and why the implementation is always a derivative the specification can regenerate, never the source of truth itself.

### Intent is durable; its expressions are perishable

A specification survives what its implementations cannot. Code fixes a thousand details that may betray the intent the moment the environment shifts — a different database, a different consistency model, a different team's conventions — and then the code is wrong while the intent is unchanged. This is why the Conjurer description is the source of truth and the artefacts are projections of it: the durable thing is what was meant, and the perishable thing is any one rendering of it. A model that stays in Conjurer and never becomes code is still the authoritative statement against which every future implementation is measured.

### Consistency alone does not establish intent

A practice can be consistent by accident — everyone copied the first example — or consistent because it is abandoned-but-not-removed, where old code is uniform and new code has quietly moved on. Uniformity is evidence of *a* pattern, never proof that the pattern was *meant*. To read intent from consistency, you must distinguish a deliberate convention from an accident and from drift, and you must say what threshold of consistency you are trusting. The most consistent thing about a codebase is sometimes its worst habit.

### Attested beats inferred; declared beats observed

Not all evidence is equal, and the discipline is to read from the strongest first. A rule written in a config and enforced by a linter is firmer than the same rule guessed from code at eighty-percent consistency. A type declaration is firmer evidence of an entity than a call pattern. A stated reason in a commit is firmer than a structural guess — though even a stated reason is only inferred intent, since it may be post-hoc or stale. When direct evidence exists, inference is not a substitute for reading it; the gravest recovery error is to infer weakly what was declared plainly.

### When evidence disagrees, the disagreement is the finding

When a linter forbids what the code does, or a comment claims what the code contradicts, neither reading is simply wrong — the *project* is inconsistent, and that inconsistency is information. The honest move is to recover the discrepancy itself rather than silently letting the config's claim or the code's practice win. The same holds for what cannot be recovered at all: a gap is not silence to be papered over but an explicit question to be carried forward. What you could not learn is itself something you learned.

### Hiding uncertainty is worse than admitting it

A recovery that presents a guess as a fact is worse than no recovery, because it launders the guess into a premise that every later decision then trusts. A language that pretends to deliver guarantees it cannot enforce is worse than one that names its limits and lets practitioners work confidently within them. Calibrated honesty is not weakness; it is what makes the rest trustworthy. This is why certainty in Conjurer is graded rather than assumed, why limits are named rather than glossed, and why confidence is preserved structurally all the way through to emission.

### Fabricated rationale is the cardinal sin

The strongest temptation, in recovery and in explanation alike, is to supply a plausible reason so the record looks complete. This is the one thing never to do, because a fabricated rationale is indistinguishable from a real one and will mislead every future choice that trusts it. If the why is not recoverable, mark it speculative or record it as unreconstructable — never invent. A claimed certainty that the evidence does not support manufactures false confidence: a risk score is not a proof, a diagnosis is not a deduction, and dressing an inductive conclusion as a deductive one is a lie about how much is known.

### Plural meaning is the nature of meaning, not a defect

That a text supports more than one faithful reading is not a deficiency to be overcome — it is what meaning is. Conjurer treats this as a feature: some ambiguity is a deliberate invitation for judgment, not an error to be specified away, and over-specifying what "warmer" or "more encouraging" means would foreclose good solutions no complete specification would have reached. Productive ambiguity is how the best collaborative work happens. The corollary holds for inference under similarity: an analogy is defeated by the differences it ignores, compatibility is not entailment, and a conclusion drawn from a remote resemblance is worse than no conclusion at all.

### Why is the hardest thing to know

Across every artefact, *what* was done is far easier to recover than *why* it was done. Intent behind a choice is the most deeply buried layer — rarely written down, and when written, suspect. This is not a failing of any particular tool; it is the shape of the problem. The right response is not to try harder to be certain about why, but to be honest about how uncertain the why is: separate it from the what, grade it conservatively, and let the unrecoverable reasons become the open questions that a successor must answer rather than the false foundations they would otherwise build on.

### Symmetry compresses; broken symmetry informs

Conjurer is full of dualities, and the strong ones are genuine inverses: manifestation and exhumation, `given` and `ensure`, `d/explore` and `x/recover-model`, `e/formalize` and `e/simplify`. Where a faithful inverse exists the language exploits it — the backward direction is nearly free once the forward is known, which is much of why the grimoires feel discovered rather than invented, and why exhume was largely *dictated* by the forward flow it reverses. But not every pairing is real. `refine`, `witness`, and `ward` have no clean inverse, and manufacturing a dual where none exists would itself violate *consistency alone does not establish intent*.

The meaning lives where the symmetry breaks. Manifestation *destroys* specificity — one specification is faithful to many implementations, and the system picks one. Exhumation *cannot restore* it — you recover graded evidence, never the lost original. The round trip is lossy in a fixed direction, the same arrow entropy follows, and Conjurer's response is not to deny the loss but to measure it: confidence grades, attestation, and calibrated certainty are the instruments. What cannot be conserved must at least be accounted for. The same break is what makes collaboration productive rather than redundant: practitioner and system are *differently fallible*, so their independent readings triangulate past either alone — and `s/counter-manifest` manufactures exactly that second, differently-shaped reading when none arises on its own.

The practical corollary: **separate the deterministic plan from the generative act, and verify the first before risking the second.** Resolving references and ordering dependencies loses nothing and can be checked; generating from the plan is lossy and cannot be undone. So `materialise` runs a preflight, an incantation previews its expansion, a workflow dry-runs, exhumation grades before it emits. Do the lossless half, confirm it, then incur the half that cannot be taken back — generating against an unverified plan is the code-generation form of inventing a rationale, and the remedy is structural, not careful.

## What Conjurer is not

**Conjurer is not prompt engineering.** Prompts are flat, single-turn, and informal. Conjurer invocations are structured, composable, context-aware, and iterable. A prompt is a letter; a Conjurer session is a working relationship.

**Conjurer is not a domain-specific language.** DSLs sacrifice generality for expressiveness in a narrow domain. Conjurer is general-purpose — it addresses any domain through its grimoire system — while remaining semantically rich in each of them.

**Conjurer is not a specification language.** Specification languages like TLA+ or Alloy describe systems formally so they can be verified. Conjurer describes systems declaratively so they can be manifested. Verification is not the goal; creation is.

**Conjurer is not natural language programming.** Natural language is unstructured; Conjurer has syntax, composition rules, and semantic conventions. The structure is not a tax on expressiveness — it is what makes invocations composable, context-aware, and reusable across sessions.

**Conjurer is not a thin wrapper around LLM prompts.** The grimoire system, context inheritance, execution primitives, and semantic constructs constitute a genuine language with semantics. The LLM is the runtime, but the language has its own theory.

**Conjurer is not session-scoped.** A conversation ends; a `.cnj` file persists. Conjurer projects span sessions, editors, and agents — with the `.cnj` file carrying the project's intellectual history intact from one context to the next. This is a fundamentally different model from an AI assistant that forgets everything when the chat closes.

---

## The grimoire ecosystem

Conjurer's standard library is organized into grimoires — thematic collections of invocations, each encoding specialized expertise. Every grimoire is a literate programming artifact: philosophy, function specifications, and worked examples woven together as a unified document.

The grimoires are peers, not a hierarchy. `core` is foundational in the sense that its constructs appear in all programs — but `semantics` is not less important than `domain`; they address different concerns with equal depth.

| Grimoire | Namespace | What it encodes |
|---|---|---|
| **core** | _(none)_ | The language itself — fundamentals, composition, abstraction (`spell`, `charm`, `incantation`), execution primitives, certainty contracts (`given`/`ensure`), reflection, and ecosystem connectives (`charter`, `target`, `asset`, `handover`, `grimoire`) |
| **domain** | `d/` | Knowledge extraction: exploring documents, modeling domains, resolving conflicts between sources |
| **data** | `data/` | The full data lifecycle: schema definition, generation, transformation, validation, provenance, and privacy |
| **web** | `w/` | Web development: style extraction, component generation, full-stack prototyping, accessibility-first design |
| **semantics** | `s/` | Deep textual understanding: multi-model analysis, perspectival interpretation, dialectical synthesis |
| **orchestrate** | `o/` | Runtime workflow coordination: multi-stage pipelines, saga patterns, circuit breakers, human-in-the-loop |
| **eloquence** | `e/` | Communication as a first-class concern: audience adaptation, tone, rhetorical structure, plain language |
| **reasoning** | `r/` | Logical inference: deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning with full derivation tracing |
| **taxonomy** | `t/` | Classification: taxonomy definition, item classification, cross-system alignment, versioned evolution |
| **agent** | `a/` | Autonomous action: agent definition, invocation, delegation, multi-agent coordination, and quality loops |
| **exhume** | `x/` | Code archaeology: recovering a domain model, technical stack, conventions, decisions, and a continuable `.cnj` from an existing codebase — the inverse of the forward flow |
| **foresight** | `f/` | Forward-looking structured opinion: graded deferred candidates, dated reassessment that preserves the trajectory of judgment, and the promotion that closes a candidate into a decision |

Most grimoires manifest intent forward into artefacts. `exhume` is the exception that proves the shape of the whole: it runs the flow backward, recovering specification from code that already exists. No further grimoires are currently under active consideration for addition to the standard library.

## The ecosystem layer: Conjurer as project memory

Sessions end. Projects do not.

This is the gap that the ecosystem layer addresses. A Conjurer session produces knowledge — domain models, design decisions, semantic analyses, workflow specifications. Without persistence, that knowledge evaporates when the chat closes. The next session starts from scratch. The same decisions get re-made, re-argued, sometimes reversed without anyone remembering why they were made in the first place. This is project entropy: the gradual degradation of shared understanding through context loss.

The `.cnj` file is the antidote. Every serious Conjurer project produces one — a structured, version-controlled artifact that accumulates the project's intellectual history in the language of the domain itself. Not a chat transcript (unstructured, verbose, tool-specific). Not a requirements document (prose, loses the reasoning). A `.cnj` file is machine-parseable, human-readable, Git-friendly, and composable. Drop it into any editor that understands Conjurer and the full project context is restored instantly.

### The four ecosystem constructs

Four constructs in `core` operate at this project level rather than within a session:

**`charter`** is the session anchor — the first construct in every `.cnj` file. It captures the problem domain, goals, audience, a dated decision log, and open questions. Every session that attaches a `.cnj` file reads the `charter` first and continues without re-explanation. The decision log is particularly important: decisions that were made and then forgotten are a primary source of project entropy. An append-only, dated, reasoned log prevents this.

**`target`** declares the implementation form of a specific output: which language, which framework, which team standard, which artefacts to produce. Most domain knowledge stays as Conjurer permanently — it is the authoritative specification. Only specific surfaces are declared as targets and materialised into code or other artefacts. This selective materialisation is a deliberate design choice, not an accident: most of what is interesting and durable about a domain is better expressed in Conjurer than in TypeScript.

**`asset`** registers external capabilities — coding standards, style guides, component libraries, domain vocabularies — making them referenceable by name throughout the project. A team's coding standard registered as an asset is not an invisible convention carried in developers' heads. It is an inspectable, versioned, agent-visible specification that any agent joining the project can fetch and apply. The standard is applied because it was given to the agent, not because the practitioner remembered to mention it.

**`handover`** packages the current session's context and transfers it to a specialist agent — another LLM instance, a code-generation agent, a documentation agent. The handover is not a prompt. It is a structured context object containing the charter, the domain model, the relevant target specifications, the registered assets, and the decision log. Everything the receiving agent needs is explicit, complete, and inspectable.

### The boundary between core and orchestrate

One distinction is worth making explicit. `orchestrate` coordinates *runtime service operations*: workflows, sagas, circuit breakers, scheduled jobs. These are things that happen inside a running system. `handover` coordinates *LLM agent context across sessions and tools*: this is an entirely different concern. The placement of `handover` in `core`'s ecosystem layer, alongside `charter`, `target`, and `asset`, reflects this: these four constructs operate at the project and tooling level, not at the runtime service level.

### Selective materialisation

A single Conjurer project may produce artefacts of several different kinds — and some parts may produce nothing at all except Conjurer specification. This is not a failure mode. A beautifully articulated domain model that stays in Conjurer is the authoritative specification against which all implementations are eventually measured. The implementations are derivatives; the Conjurer description is the source of truth.

The `target` construct makes materialisation decisions explicit. A project might materialise three REST endpoints in TypeScript, a PostgreSQL schema, and a Markdown architecture document — while leaving the entire domain model, all business rules, and all classification schemes as Conjurer. The `.cnj` file declares which is which. Nothing is accidentally omitted; nothing is accidentally generated.

---

## The practitioner

Conjurer is designed for people who think in systems but prefer to communicate in intent. The ideal practitioner is not someone who wants to avoid writing code — it is someone who recognises that the highest-leverage thing they can do is specify *what* a system should do with great clarity, and then trust a capable collaborator to determine *how*.

This requires a different skill than conventional programming. The skill is not precision in syntax — it is precision in *intent*. It is knowing what you want clearly enough to state it declaratively. It is knowing when to be specific and when to leave productive space for judgment. It is knowing when the first manifestation has revealed something about your requirements that you did not know before you saw it.

These are the skills of a good systems thinker, a good designer, a good product leader. Conjurer makes them executable.

## How to read this specification

**Start with this document, then `core`.** `conjurer.md` establishes the philosophical foundation; `grimoires/core.md` provides the language itself — all constructs with full signatures and examples. The grimoire opens with a construct map and progresses through seven thematic parts: fundamentals, composition, execution, certainty, typing, reflection, and ecosystem. Read Part IV (Certainty and contracts) when the work demands binding guarantees, and Part VII (Session and ecosystem constructs) early when starting any serious project — `charter`, `target`, `asset`, and `handover` shape how the whole project is organised.

**Read examples before signatures.** Function signatures are precise but abstract. Examples are concrete and reveal the intent behind the design. When a signature confuses you, skip to the first example.

**Treat the integration patterns as the curriculum.** The most important things in Conjurer happen at the boundaries between grimoires — where `d/explore` flows into `data/schema`, where `s/texan` feeds `e/compose`, where `r/derive` draws conclusions from a `t/classify` result. These patterns are where the language's expressive power becomes visible.

**Read the implementation notes for LLM processors.** Even if you are not building a Conjurer interpreter, these sections articulate the semantic commitments the language makes — what each construct promises, how ambiguity should be resolved, what production quality means in context. They are the language's contract with its runtime.

**Use the `.cnj` file spec in `template.md`.** Before starting a project, read the canonical `.cnj` file structure. The `charter` construct is where every project begins; everything else grows from it.
